"""
Post launch alerts to Slack after the daily refresh.

Reads the signals scripts/refresh_data.py wrote into data.js — the same ones
the dashboard's "Needs attention" panel renders — ranks them across every live
launch and posts the top few.

WHY IT DOES NOT POST EVERYTHING, EVERY DAY
------------------------------------------
"Kaisa projects out of stock" stays true until somebody reorders. Posting the
same five lines every morning gets the channel muted inside a week, and then
the one that mattered gets missed too. So:

  * A weekday run posts only alerts that are NEW, or whose severity changed.
    Nothing new means no message at all.
  * Monday posts the full top-N digest regardless, plus anything that cleared
    since the last digest, so nothing quietly disappears.

State lives in config/alert_state.json, committed by the workflow, so the
history of what was alerted and when is in git rather than in a database this
static site does not have.

REVIEW & DRY-RUN FIRST
----------------------
Read-only apart from config/alert_state.json. `--dry-run` prints the message
that would be posted and writes nothing.

Environment:
  SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL   Slack incoming webhook. Without it the script exits 0
                      without posting, so a missing secret degrades instead of
                      failing the refresh.
  SLACK_ALERT_LIMIT   How many alerts to post (default 5).
  DASHBOARD_URL       Base URL used for the links (default: the internal
                      portal route).
