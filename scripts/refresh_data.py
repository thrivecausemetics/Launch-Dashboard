"""
Regenerate data.js for the Thrive Causemetics Launch Dashboard from Snowflake.

Reads config/launches.json, runs read-only SELECTs against DAASITY_DB, and
rewrites data.js in the repo root with the same structure the dashboard
already consumes (window.DASHBOARD_DATA).

REVIEW & DRY-RUN FIRST
----------------------
Every query is a read-only SELECT, but they run against production data
(Shopify + NetSuite via Daasity, GA4, Recharge). `--dry-run` prints every
query without connecting.

All column names in COLS were verified against DAASITY_DB INFORMATION_SCHEMA
on 2026-07-23. Methodology notes (documented deviations from the old manual
snapshot, which may differ by a low single-digit %):
  - Net sales = SUM((PRICE - DISCOUNT_AMOUNT/QTY) * QTY) on line items with
    REFUND_FLAG = FALSE, converted to USD via CURRENCY_CONVERSION_RATE.
  - New vs returning customers = first-ever UOS order date on/after launch
    date (the old snapshot estimated this from a historical ratio).
  - % to Plan = units vs SUM(PLAN_UNITS) between launch date and cutoff.
  - Cross-sell pairs = same-cart co-occurrence events from
    DRP.PRODUCT_AFFINITY_SETS (launch SKU as primary, ordered in window).
  - Category membership = UOS.PRODUCTS.PRODUCT_TYPE matched with the ILIKE
    patterns in config/launches.json (category_type_patterns).

Credentials come from environment variables (set as GitHub Actions secrets):
  SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT     e.g. abc12345.us-east-1
  SNOWFLAKE_USER
  SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD    (or SNOWFLAKE_PRIVATE_KEY_B64 for key-pair auth)
  SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE
  SNOWFLAKE_ROLE        optional
  SNOWFLAKE_DATABASE    optional, default DAASITY_DB
  DATA_CUTOFF           optional YYYY-MM-DD override; default = yesterday.
                        Never set to today or a future date — the last full
                        day of data is always yesterday.
